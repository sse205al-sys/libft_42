# Libft - Your First C Library

## Description
**Libft** is the first project in the 42 curriculum. The goal of this activity is to code a C library containing a collection of general-purpose functions that will be used throughout the curriculum.

This project allows us to understand the inner workings of standard functions, memory management, and data structures by re-implementing them from scratch.

### Library Content
The library (`libft.a`) includes a detailed set of functions:
1.  **Libc Functions:** Re-implementation of standard C functions (e.g., `memset`, `strlen`, `atoi`, `calloc`).
2.  **Additional Functions:** Useful utilities for string manipulation not present in libc (e.g., `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`).
3.  **Linked List Functions:** A set of functions to manage and manipulate linked lists (Bonus part).

### sourcess
1. youtube to understand the Memory Allocation and the linkedlist 
2. AI helped me to creat the make file 
3. github

## Instructions

### Compilation
To compile the library, run the following command at the root of the repository:

```bash
make
